# 🎨 Figma Integration Setup

This guide will help you extract your Summer Walker App design from Figma directly into our Next.js app.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Figma Personal Access Token**
   - Go to [Figma Settings](https://www.figma.com/settings)
   - Scroll down to "Personal access tokens"
   - Click "Create new token"
   - Name it "Summer Walker App"
   - Copy the token (keep it safe!)

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Add your Figma token to environment variables

```bash
# Add to your .env.local file
FIGMA_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Step 2: Run the Figma analysis

```bash
npm run analyze-figma
```

This will:
- ✅ Extract all colors from your design
- ✅ Extract typography styles
- ✅ Find all components and their structure
- ✅ Generate Tailwind CSS configuration
- ✅ Create a component map for building

## 📁 Output Files

After running the analysis, you'll find these files in `figma-analysis/`:

- `design-tokens.json` - All colors, fonts, and design tokens
- `tailwind-extension.js` - Ready-to-use Tailwind config
- `component-structure.json` - Complete component hierarchy

## 🛠 Manual Alternative

If you prefer not to use the API, you can also:

1. **Dev Mode**: Use your [dev mode link](https://www.figma.com/design/zAPFTVAhTAJS3Y37HpzjJX/Summer-Walker-App?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=JiShv2o2UsmSnhke-1)
2. **Inspect Elements**: Click on any element to see CSS properties
3. **Copy Values**: Manually copy colors, fonts, and spacing values
4. **Share Screenshots**: Export key screens for reference

## 🎯 What We'll Build

Based on your Figma design, we'll create:
- ✅ Pixel-perfect hero slider
- ✅ Music player with your exact styling
- ✅ Event cards matching your design
- ✅ Merch grid with proper spacing
- ✅ Admin dashboard with consistent branding

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Get your Figma token
2. Run `npm run analyze-figma`
3. I'll use the extracted design tokens to build components
4. We can iterate and refine as needed

Ready to extract your design? Just share your Figma token or let me know if you want to try the manual approach first!
